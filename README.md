# C++/WinRT

## Introduction

This repo house samples I've developed for familiarising myself with C++/WinRT. C++/WinRT is a modern C++ language projection over the Windows Runtime APIs.

## Building

You need Visual Studio 2022 with the _Desktop development with C++_ and the _Universal Windows Platform_ development workloads installed. Make sure the _C++/WinRT_ option under _SDKs, libraries, and frameworks_ in Visual Studio Installer is selected. You should then be able to open and build the cpp-winrt.sln file in Visual Studio.
